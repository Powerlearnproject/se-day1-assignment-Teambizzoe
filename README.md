Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

_Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry._
Software engineering involves designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software products. It's been the massive drive behind the technology industry in various spheres of communication, healthcare, and software development.

_Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering._
the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


_List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle._
from Requirements (survey) to Design (architecture & UI) to Implementation (write code & build software), to Deployment, and lastly, Maintenance.

_Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate._
The waterfall approach utilises a sequential mode of project execution, while the Agile approach is much more focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

_Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team._
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

_Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each._
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
VCSs are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

_What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges._
These challenges include Changing Requirements, tight deadlines, technical debts, etc.
Overcoming these challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

_Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance._
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

_Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models._
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or instructions concisely and specifically to get desired search outputs.

_Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective._
Vague: Give me guidelines to become great.
Prompt Engineering: What does it take to become great in what I am doing as a seasoned researcher in the agricultural field?
The improved prompt clarified what would be brought back, and the AI would dive deeper into my discipline to give me something spectacular than something generic.
